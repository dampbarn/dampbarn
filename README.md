- 👋 Hi, I’m @dampbarn
- 👀 I’m interested in making an app for pin pointing a spesific place in the city. Benches for example(this is not the actual idea). I want to build this into an app with GPS and use Google Maps to 
- show the location so people easily know where to go when looking for that particular thing. I believe we also will be collabing with local communities and citys.
-
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the app.
